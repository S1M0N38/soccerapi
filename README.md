Soccer API (Application Programming Interface) is a simple wrapper build on top
of some bookmakers (now only 888sport) in order to get data about soccer (aka
football) odds using python commands.

## ⚽️ The goal

The goal of the project is provided a enjoyable way to get odds data for
different soccer leagues. Usually, if someone want to get these types of data,
have to build by him self (and from scratch) a program able to scrape the
betting site or use some kind paid API. Soccer API try to address this problem.

## 💡 The philosophy

Keep it simple. Simple API, simple http requests, few dependencies. In the past
I have try to build some heavy framework able to scraping site (using selenium
able to handle complex JavaScript): was a unmaintainable nightmare.

## 📘 The documentation

The [documentation](https://s1m0n38.github.io/soccerapi/#/) contain all the
useful information to use this API at its best. Read it carefully.
